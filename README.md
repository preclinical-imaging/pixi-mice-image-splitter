# PIXI Mice Image Splitter

The *splitter_of_mice* package was originally designed to automatically segment and split INVEON PET/CT images of mice 
into individual image sessions. The package has been extended to support splitting DICOM PET/CT images of mice. The
package was also extended to work with the XNAT Container Services plugin and the PIXI plugin.
